## Semantic Segmentation
This project is basically a recreation of pyimagesearch blog post “Semantic segmentation with OpenCV and deep learning”, in this project I performed semantic segmentation on an image using OpenCV and Deep Learning. ENet Deep Learning architecture was used to perform semantic segmentation to image.
